- OSD/OS is developed by mehmet raif tasdemir (darkBLACK), [github.com/mehmetraif](https://github.com/mehmetraif).
- It is a modified version of [240-MP](https://github.com/anthonycaccese/240-MP) by Anthony Caccese and its contributors: the app it all started from.
- OSD/OS's changes to 240-MP were written with [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code), Anthropic's coding agent.
- The OSD/OS logo, the channel logo over the picture and the boot screen's cassette were made with [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com), OpenAI's assistant.
- 240-MP was made the same way. In Anthony's words, from its README: "Because this is a hobby project (and a fairly niche use case), I am using [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/product/claude-code) to build a large part of the backend C++ code and structure the modules. If you have concerns with that, I am glad to talk through it. Also, please feel free to fork this repo, update any aspects and tailor things to your own use case; that's why the source is fully open and available."
- The `VCR OSD Mono` font was created by Riciery Santos Leal (a.k.a. mrmanet) https://www.dafont.com/vcr-osd-mono.font
- The `Unifont` font (used as a fallback for characters that VCR OSD Mono does not cover) is GNU Unifont by Roman Czyborra, Paul Hardy, et al., licensed under the SIL Open Font License v1.1. https://unifoundry.com/unifont/ — license text: [assets/fonts/LICENSE-unifont.txt](https://github.com/mehmetraif/OSD-OS/blob/main/assets/fonts/LICENSE-unifont.txt)

## 240-MP

OSD/OS grew out of [240-MP](https://github.com/anthonycaccese/240-MP), Anthony Caccese's VCR-style frontend for CRTs. Its own pictures show where it started, before OSD/OS's menus:
