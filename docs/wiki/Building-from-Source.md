# Building from source

How to build OSD/OS yourself, on a Mac, on Raspberry Pi OS and on Debian or Ubuntu, with the exact commands; what each optional part adds; how to run your build and its regression tests; and how the project's own builds are made: the CI workflows, releases, the AppImage and the OSD/OS image. [BUILDING.md](https://github.com/mehmetraif/OSD-OS/blob/main/BUILDING.md) has the long story behind each step, linked below where it matters.

## What it takes

OSD/OS is one C++17 program (Qt 6 and QML) built with CMake 3.21 or newer. CMake looks for:

| Dependency | What for | If it is missing |
|---|---|---|
| Qt 6: Core, Concurrent, Gui, Quick, Qml, Network, Svg | Everything | The configure fails |
| OpenSSL | Plex's sign-in: the Ed25519 device key that signs its tokens (`OpenSSL::Crypto`) | The configure fails |
| SDL2 | Gamepads (`InputManager`) | The configure fails |
| libdrm, through pkg-config (Linux) | Giving the screen to mpv and taking it back on a Pi (`DisplayHandoff`) | The configure fails |
| Qt Shader Tools | The effects' shaders, compiled into the binary ([below](#qt-shader-tools)) | `Qt Shader Tools not found — the shader effects will be unavailable` |
| libmpv's headers, through pkg-config | Transparent Background: video inside the app's window | `libmpv headers not found — Transparent Background will be unavailable` |
| PC/SC (`libpcsclite`, Linux; macOS has it) | ACR122U and other PC/SC NFC readers | `PC/SC not found — NFC reader module will build with PN532 USB serial support only` |
| Qt D-Bus (Linux) | Settings → Bluetooth, through BlueZ | `Qt D-Bus not found — Settings → Bluetooth will be unavailable` |
| git | The commit in Settings → About → Build | The build has the day alone |

At run time OSD/OS starts other programs rather than linking them: **mpv** for every video (0.38 or newer), and for some modules yt-dlp and Deno (YouTube), FluidSynth with a SoundFont and openmpt123 (menu music in MIDI or a tracker's format), Chromium with Widevine (Netflix and Prime Video). None of them is needed to build.

Get the source first:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mehmetraif/OSD-OS.git
cd OSD-OS
```

## macOS (Apple Silicon)

### Qt

Any of three:

- **Qt's online installer** ([qt.io/download](https://qt.io/download)), installed to `~/Qt`. Under Additional Libraries, add **Qt Shader Tools**.
- **aqtinstall**, the unattended installer behind the release workflow's Qt. The workflow builds with Qt 6.7 and its `qtshadertools` module:

  ```sh
  python3 -m pip install aqtinstall
  aqt install-qt mac desktop 6.7.3 clang_64 -m qtshadertools -O ~/Qt
  ```

- **Homebrew**: `brew install qt@6` (an alias of Homebrew's `qt`, which includes Qt Shader Tools).

### The other packages

```sh
brew install cmake sdl2 mpv pkgconf      # build tools, gamepads, playback, libmpv's headers
brew install fluid-synth libopenmpt      # optional: menu music in MIDI and trackers' formats
brew install yt-dlp deno                 # optional: the YouTube module
```

- `sdl2`, the formula BUILDING.md names, is Homebrew's `sdl2-compat`, SDL2's API on top of SDL3. The release workflow builds SDL2 2.32.10 from source instead, so that the DMG carries SDL2 itself and no SDL3.
- mpv is found on the `PATH` when a video plays; OSD/OS adds `/opt/homebrew/bin` and `/usr/local/bin` to its own `PATH` at start, since an app opened from the Finder gets a short one. With `pkgconf`, CMake finds mpv's headers and builds Transparent Background in, which opens Homebrew's libmpv at run time.
- A MIDI file needs a General MIDI SoundFont as well, which Homebrew's FluidSynth doesn't bring: put a `.sf2` in the data folder's `soundfonts` folder (`~/Library/Application Support/OSD-OS/soundfonts/`).
- macOS needs no package for the NFC Reader: the PN532 USB driver talks to the reader directly, and PC/SC is part of the system.

### Build and run

```sh
# First time, and after any change to CMakeLists.txt:
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=~/Qt/6.7.3/macos . && cmake --build build

# After a code change:
cmake --build build

# Run, with the log in the terminal:
APP_ROOT=$(pwd) ./build/osdos.app/Contents/MacOS/osdos
```

`CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` names the Qt: the version's `macos` folder for the installer's or aqtinstall's (`~/Qt/6.7.3/macos` above; BUILDING.md's example is `~/Qt/6.11.0/macos`), `$(brew --prefix)` for Homebrew's, whose Qt is linked there. Double-clicking `build/osdos.app` works too: outside CI, the build links the bundle's `Contents/Resources` to the repository, where OSD/OS finds its QML.

## Raspberry Pi OS (arm64)

On Raspberry Pi OS Trixie (Debian 13):

```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y \
  build-essential cmake pkgconf \
  qt6-base-dev qt6-declarative-dev \
  qml6-module-qtquick qml6-module-qtquick-controls \
  qml6-module-qtquick-window qml6-module-qtquick-effects \
  libqt6svg6 qt6-svg-dev qt6-svg-plugins qt6-wayland \
  qt6-shadertools-dev \
  libdrm-dev libxkbcommon-dev libssl-dev \
  libsdl2-dev \
  mpv
```

This is [BUILDING.md](https://github.com/mehmetraif/OSD-OS/blob/main/BUILDING.md#raspberry-pi-os-arm64)'s list less `libpcsclite-dev` and `libmpv-dev`, which are optional (below). `pkgconf` is there for CMake to find libdrm (the CI job on Raspberry Pi OS installs it), and `qml6-module-qtquick-effects` for the Weather and NFC Reader screens, which import it (`install.sh` installs it). The optional parts:

| Package | Adds |
|---|---|
| `libmpv-dev` | Transparent Background, built in. At run time it opens `libmpv2`, which `install.sh` and the image install |
| `qt6-shadertools-dev` (in the list above) | The effects' shaders; leave it out and they are left out. `qt6-shader-baker` brings `qsb`, for a theme's own shader |
| `libpcsclite-dev` | PC/SC NFC readers. Run `bash scripts/setup-nfc-reader.sh` once either way: it lets the user open a PN532 reader, and sets up `pcscd` where PC/SC is usable |
| `fluidsynth timgm6mb-soundfont openmpt123` | Menu music in MIDI and trackers' formats (run time only) |
| `bluez`, and the user in the `bluetooth` group | Settings → Bluetooth (run time; Raspberry Pi OS Lite has BlueZ). `sudo usermod -aG bluetooth $USER` |

For YouTube, yt-dlp from its own releases (the one apt brings is too old) and Deno, on the `PATH` of the user that runs OSD/OS ([yt-dlp's EJS notes](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/EJS)):

```sh
sudo wget https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases/latest/download/yt-dlp -O /usr/local/bin/yt-dlp
sudo chmod a+rx /usr/local/bin/yt-dlp
```

Build, then run:

```sh
cmake -B build              # first time, and after CMakeLists.txt changes
cmake --build build         # every time

APP_ROOT=$(pwd) ./build/osdos                        # with a desktop
APP_ROOT=$(pwd) QT_QPA_PLATFORM=eglfs ./build/osdos  # Raspberry Pi OS Lite, no desktop
```

Apt's Qt is found without `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`. Without a desktop, Qt draws straight to the screen through KMS/DRM (EGLFS):

- **Stop the service first** if OSD/OS is installed with autostart: `sudo systemctl stop osdos`. Two programs can't both hold the screen.
- **On a Pi 5**, run your build through `scripts/rpi-run-local.sh` (`OSDOS_BIN=/path/to/osdos` for another binary). Like the installed launcher, it points EGLFS at the card with a connected display, where a Pi 5's render-only GPU node would otherwise come first. Unlike the launcher, it doesn't read the output a display preset names (`# osdos-output:`), so it takes the first connected one. Run it from the Pi's own console, not over SSH.

## Debian or Ubuntu on a PC (x86_64)

```sh
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential cmake pkgconf \
  libdrm-dev libssl-dev libsdl2-dev libpcsclite-dev \
  libgl1-mesa-dev libxkbcommon-dev mpv
```

`pkgconf` is there for CMake to find libdrm, as on the Pi; `libpcsclite-dev` is optional (PC/SC readers), and so is `libmpv-dev` (Transparent Background).

Qt comes from the distribution (`qt6-base-dev qt6-declarative-dev qt6-svg-dev qt6-shadertools-dev` and the `qml6-module-qtquick*` modules) or from Qt's installer or aqtinstall with Qt Shader Tools, CMake then pointed at it:

```sh
aqt install-qt linux desktop 6.7.3 linux_gcc_64 -m qtshadertools -O ~/Qt
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=~/Qt/6.7.3/gcc_64 && cmake --build build
APP_ROOT=$(pwd) ./build/osdos
```

Two things to know about Ubuntu 24.04:

- **Its Qt is 6.4**, the oldest the project builds with (CI builds and tests on it). QtQuick.Effects came with Qt 6.5, so on 6.4 the Weather and NFC Reader screens don't load: the log says `module "QtQuick.Effects" is not installed`. A Qt from the installer doesn't have this gap.
- **Its mpv is 0.37**, one release too old: OSD/OS asks mpv for forced subtitles only (`--subs-with-matching-audio=forced`), which came in 0.38, and mpv 0.37 refuses to start with it. Build a newer one with `scripts/build-mpv.sh` ([below](#the-appimage-and-mpv-038)). OSD/OS takes an `mpv` beside its own binary before the one on the `PATH`:

  ```sh
  cp "$(scripts/build-mpv.sh)" build/mpv
  ```

## Qt Shader Tools

Qt Shader Tools compiles the shaders in [`shaders/`](https://github.com/mehmetraif/OSD-OS/tree/main/shaders) into the binary at build time (`qt_add_shaders`), for every graphics API Qt Quick draws with: GLSL ES 100 and GLSL 120 and 150 (OpenGL, and OpenGL ES on the Pi), SPIR-V, HLSL and MSL. Nothing of it is needed at run time. They are:

| Shader | What it draws |
|---|---|
| `effects.frag` | The screen effects (Scanlines, CRT, VHS) and the text effects (Rainbow, Shimmer, Glow, Flicker), in one pass over the menus |
| `bg-matrix.frag`, `bg-fire.frag`, `bg-stars.frag`, `bg-snow.frag` | The background effects |
| `ripple.frag`, `wave.frag`, `drop.frag` | The Ripple, Wave and Drop transitions |

A build without it runs as well: Settings leaves out Text Effect, Background Effect and Screen Effect and the Ripple, Wave and Drop transitions, and a theme's built-in effects of those kinds go with them (its Ripple, Wave or Drop fades instead). What needs no shader stays: the selector effects (sparks, lightning, the rainbow) and the Fade and Cube transitions. A theme's own compiled shader, a `.qsb` in its folder, still runs. The effects also need a GPU: under Qt's software renderer Settings leaves them out whatever the build. More in [Effects](https://github.com/mehmetraif/OSD-OS/wiki/Effects) and [Shaders](https://github.com/mehmetraif/OSD-OS/wiki/Shaders).

## Running your build

```sh
APP_ROOT=$(pwd) ./build/osdos
```

- **`APP_ROOT`** is where OSD/OS finds `Main.qml`, `views/`, `modules/`, `assets/` and `scripts/`: the repository, for a build from source.
- **`DATA_ROOT`** gives the build a data folder of its own, so it doesn't touch your settings. The folder must exist:

  ```sh
  mkdir -p ~/osdos-test-data
  DATA_ROOT=~/osdos-test-data APP_ROOT=$(pwd) ./build/osdos
  ```

  Without it, the build uses the usual data folder: `~/.local/share/OSD-OS/` on Linux, `~/Library/Application Support/OSD-OS/` on a Mac ([Configuration files](https://github.com/mehmetraif/OSD-OS/wiki/Configuration-Files)).
- **The log** prints in the terminal. A build configured without `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`, as above, keeps OSD/OS's debug lines, which a Release build strips (`-DQT_NO_DEBUG_OUTPUT`): the modules loaded, every setting saved, each video's mpv command line ([Troubleshooting](https://github.com/mehmetraif/OSD-OS/wiki/Troubleshooting#what-a-build-from-source-adds)).
- **The version** of a local build is `dev` (CMake's `APP_VERSION`; CI passes the tag), which Settings shows in its title bar. A `dev` build's Update screen doesn't download releases: `Dev build — self-update is disabled.`
- **Another screen.** On a Mac or a Linux desktop, `display_index` under `"app"` in `config.json` opens OSD/OS on another display; the log lists each display's index at start ([BUILDING.md → Choosing the display](https://github.com/mehmetraif/OSD-OS/blob/main/BUILDING.md#choosing-the-display-display_index)).
- **Ctrl+Q** on a keyboard quits.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mehmetraif/OSD-OS/main/docs/screenshots/about.png" width="100%" alt="Settings → About of a build from source: DEV in the title bar, and the build line with the commit and the day" />

Settings → About of a build from source: `DEV` in the title bar, and **Build** with the commit the tree was configured from and the day (CMake's `APP_BUILD`). A build keeps its configure's commit until CMake configures again.

## The AppImage and mpv 0.38

For Intel and AMD PCs and the Steam Deck, OSD/OS ships as one AppImage with Qt, SDL2 and mpv inside, so it runs on SteamOS with nothing to install. `scripts/build-appimage.sh` makes it:

```sh
CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/Qt/6.7.x/gcc_64 scripts/build-appimage.sh --configure
```

- `--configure` configures and builds a Release first; leave it out if `build/` is built already. The result is `OSD-OS-linux-x86_64.AppImage` in the repository's folder.
- On its first run the script downloads `linuxdeploy`, `linuxdeploy-plugin-qt` and `appimagetool` into `.appimage-tools/`, and keeps them.
- Its environment: `BUILD_DIR` (default `build`), `APPDIR` (default `AppDir`), `VERSION` (default `git describe`), `MPV_BIN` (the mpv to bundle, default the one on the `PATH`), `QMAKE`, `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`.
- It bundles a copy of mpv, deploys Qt, then takes out the GPU and driver libraries the target must bring itself (VA-API, GL, libdrm). It then checks every library the AppImage's programs need: one neither bundled nor allowed from the host fails the build, with the libraries named. `ALLOW_HOST_LIBS_EXTRA="soname …"` lets a release through without editing the script.
- **The bundled mpv must be 0.38 or newer.** Ubuntu 24.04's is 0.37 and 22.04's 0.34.1, so build one first and hand it over:

  ```sh
  MPV_BIN=$(scripts/build-mpv.sh) scripts/build-appimage.sh --configure
  ```

  `scripts/build-mpv.sh` compiles mpv 0.40 against the system's own FFmpeg, and prints the binary's path. It needs meson, ninja and pkg-config, FFmpeg's, libass', libplacebo's, Lua 5.2's and VA-API's development packages, and the Wayland, X11, EGL and DRM ones: the release workflow's Linux x86_64 job installs the whole list. `MPV_TAG` picks another tag, `MPV_SRC` another build folder (default `.mpv-build`).
- The machine it is built on sets its glibc floor. CI builds it on Ubuntu 24.04: glibc 2.39, a current Steam Deck and newer distributions, not Ubuntu 22.04 or Debian 12.

How the AppImage finds Wayland's libraries on X11-only systems, and its library audit, are in [BUILDING.md → Linux x86_64 (AppImage)](https://github.com/mehmetraif/OSD-OS/blob/main/BUILDING.md#linux-x86_64-appimage).

## The regression tests

A few things that are easy to break have tests in [`tests/`](https://github.com/mehmetraif/OSD-OS/tree/main/tests), built apart from the app. They need CMake, a C++17 compiler and Qt 6's Core, Concurrent, Gui, Network, Qml, Quick and Test development packages, and libdrm's on Linux; not mpv, FluidSynth or a screen.

```sh
cmake -S tests -B build-tests
cmake --build build-tests --parallel
ctest --test-dir build-tests --output-on-failure
```

They take under a minute; `ctest --test-dir build-tests -R looks` runs one by name.

| Test | What it covers |
|---|---|
| `storage_search` | Local Files' search keeps the first 200 matches by name; a search replaced by the next is never reported; the backend can go away mid-search; settings and resume points survive a restart; a save that can't be made leaves the old file as it was (skipped when run as root, which writes anyway); state files keep their permissions, a token owner-only from its first write |
| `looks` | Themes and skins read from the app's folder and the data folder's: listed by name, each once, the data folder's in place of the app's; a skin's pictures and icons read from its own folder only; a theme's colours, skin, effects and music read, what can't be used left empty; an id is a folder's name, never a path |
| `playback_retire` (Linux) | One video handed over to the next, against a stand-in for mpv: the app goes on while the old player quits, of several asked for in a row only the last plays, a stop while waiting starts nothing, a player that ignores being told to quit is killed a second later, and the menu music is gone before a video's player starts |
| `menu_music` (Linux) | The menu music, against stand-ins for mpv, FluidSynth and openmpt123: it plays when wanted and stops when not, a hold stops it before `hold()` returns, a file mpv can't play isn't tried again, a MIDI file is made into a WAV with the right SoundFont, a tracker's module goes to openmpt123 when mpv can't play it |

[tests/README.md](https://github.com/mehmetraif/OSD-OS/blob/main/tests/README.md) has each test's cases, and the checks that want a Raspberry Pi: the screen changing hands between the app and mpv, power cuts while saving, menu music on the sound card in use. A test of your own goes in `tests/CMakeLists.txt` with the sources it needs; [Writing a module](https://github.com/mehmetraif/OSD-OS/wiki/Writing-a-Module#a-test-in-tests) shows one.

## Continuous integration

Four workflows in [`.github/workflows`](https://github.com/mehmetraif/OSD-OS/tree/main/.github/workflows):

| Workflow | Runs on | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| [`regression-tests.yml`](https://github.com/mehmetraif/OSD-OS/blob/main/.github/workflows/regression-tests.yml) | Every pull request, and every push to `main`, that touches `src/`, `tests/`, `CMakeLists.txt` or the workflow | Builds the app (Release) and the tests, and runs the tests, in two jobs. **Linux**: Ubuntu 24.04 on x64 and on arm64, with apt's Qt 6.4, the oldest the releases are built with. **Raspberry Pi OS (trixie, arm64)**: a `debian:trixie` container with Raspberry Pi's archive added as pi-gen adds it for the image, at the commit `os/build.sh` pins, so with the Pi's own Qt (6.8) and mpv (0.40); there the tests run as an ordinary user, as OSD/OS runs on the Pi |
| [`os-image.yml`](https://github.com/mehmetraif/OSD-OS/blob/main/.github/workflows/os-image.yml) | By hand (Actions → OS image → Run workflow), and pull requests that touch `os/`, `src/boot/`, `views/BootScreen.qml`, `views/Components/VhsCassette.qml`, `scripts/install.sh` or the workflow | Builds the app for arm64 as a `dev` tarball, then the OSD/OS image from it with pi-gen, on GitHub's arm64 runners. The image is the run's `osdos-image` artifact, kept 30 days; pi-gen's logs are kept when it fails |
| [`release.yml`](https://github.com/mehmetraif/OSD-OS/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yml) | A pushed tag matching `v*.*.*` | Builds and publishes a release ([below](#making-a-release)) |
| [`wiki.yml`](https://github.com/mehmetraif/OSD-OS/blob/main/.github/workflows/wiki.yml) | A push to `main` that touches `docs/wiki/` or the workflow, and by hand | Publishes `docs/wiki` to the [wiki](https://github.com/mehmetraif/OSD-OS/wiki), page for page, replacing what the wiki had. GitHub makes a wiki's repository only once its first page is saved in the web interface, so that was done once |

A `dev` image's app never updates itself, so a branch's image can't swap itself for a release without its changes. With the repository secret `OS_FIRST_USER_PASS`, the image's `pi` user gets it as its password; without it the account is locked.

## Making a release

Releases are the owner's to make. A release starts from a version tag, `v` and a date in BUILDING.md's example (`v2026.06.04`): created on GitHub's web interface, or pushed with git as BUILDING.md shows:

```sh
git tag v2026.06.04
git push origin v2026.06.04
```

Any tag matching `v*.*.*` starts `release.yml`; one containing `-rc`, `-beta` or `-alpha` (`v1.0.0-rc1`) is published as a pre-release, a way to try the workflow: `install.sh` and the in-app updater only take the latest full release. Four builds run, the image after the arm64 one:

| Job | Runner | Makes |
|---|---|---|
| `build-macos-arm64` | `macos-15` | `OSD-OS-<tag>-macOS-arm64.dmg`: Qt 6.7 with Qt Shader Tools, SDL2 2.32.10 built from source and bundled, `macdeployqt`. With the secrets `APPLE_CERT_P12_BASE64`, `APPLE_CERT_PASSWORD`, `APPLE_ID`, `APPLE_APP_PASSWORD` and `APPLE_TEAM_ID` it is signed with the Developer ID and notarized; without them (a fork) signed ad hoc, and the release notes say how to open it the first time. mpv isn't bundled |
| `build-linux-arm64` | `ubuntu-24.04-arm` | `OSD-OS-<tag>-linux-arm64.tar.gz`, apt's Qt, for Raspberry Pi OS: `install.sh` installs it and the packages it needs |
| `build-linux-x86_64` | `ubuntu-24.04` | `OSD-OS-linux-x86_64.AppImage`, with mpv 0.40 built by `scripts/build-mpv.sh`. Its name has no version, as it updates itself in place |
| `build-os-image` | `ubuntu-24.04-arm` | `OSD-OS-<tag>-raspberry-pi.img.xz` and its `.info` (the packages on it), from the release's own tarball |

The last job, `release`, writes `SHA256SUMS` (which the in-app updater checks downloads against) and release notes with absolute links, and publishes the release with every file, `install.sh` and `setup-nfc-reader.sh` among them. While the workflow runs, each job's file can be downloaded from its run's **Artifacts**.

## Building the OSD/OS image

The image is Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit, Trixie) built by pi-gen, plus [`os/stage-osdos`](https://github.com/mehmetraif/OSD-OS/tree/main/os/stage-osdos), with the app from an arm64 release tarball. The simplest way is the **OS image** workflow on GitHub (above). Locally, with Docker on an arm64 Linux machine (an x86 one works through QEMU, but takes hours):

```sh
FIRST_USER_PASS='…' os/build.sh path/to/OSD-OS-<version>-linux-arm64.tar.gz
```

The image lands in `os/work/pi-gen/deploy/`. `os/build.sh` fetches pi-gen at the commit it pins (`PI_GEN_REF`), builds its stages 0 to 2 (Raspberry Pi OS Lite) and then OSD/OS's stage. The tarball can be a release's, or one of your own, made on an arm64 machine the way the OS image workflow makes it:

```sh
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="$PWD/install/usr/local"
cmake --build build --parallel
cmake --install build
(cd install && tar -czf ../OSD-OS-dev-linux-arm64.tar.gz .)
```

Its settings are environment variables:

| Variable | Default | |
|---|---|---|
| `FIRST_USER_PASS` | none | The first user's password. Without one the account is locked |
| `FIRST_USER_NAME` | `pi` | The first user, whom the app runs as |
| `OSDOS_DISPLAY` | `hdmi` | The first display preset (`crt-pal` for `osdos-display-crt-pal.txt`) |
| `OSDOS_STREAMING` | `1` | `0` leaves out Chromium, Widevine, cage and wtype (about 400 MB) |
| `OSDOS_YOUTUBE` | `1` | `0` leaves out yt-dlp, Deno and ffmpeg (about 90 MB) |
| `OSDOS_ROOT_SIZE` | `8` | GiB the system keeps of the card; the rest becomes the films partition on the first boot. `0`: no films partition |
| `ENABLE_SSH` | `0` | `1` turns SSH on |
| `TARGET_HOSTNAME`, `IMG_NAME` | `osdos` | |
| `WPA_COUNTRY`, `LOCALE_DEFAULT`, `KEYBOARD_KEYMAP`, `KEYBOARD_LAYOUT`, `TIMEZONE_DEFAULT`, `PUBKEY_SSH_FIRST_USER`, `PUBKEY_ONLY_SSH`, `DEPLOY_COMPRESSION` | pi-gen's; `xz` for `DEPLOY_COMPRESSION` | Passed on to pi-gen |
| `OSDOS_NATIVE` | `0` | `1` runs pi-gen directly on a Debian host, as root, instead of in Docker |
| `OSDOS_PREPARE_ONLY` | `0` | `1` sets up the pi-gen tree and its config, and stops |
| `PI_GEN_REF` | pinned | The pi-gen commit to build from |
| `WORK` | `os/work` | The working folder |

The launcher, the stop helper and the Exit to Terminal unit on the image are taken from `scripts/install.sh` as it builds, so the image and an app install can't drift apart. What the stage does, step by step, is in [os/README.md](https://github.com/mehmetraif/OSD-OS/blob/main/os/README.md#building) and on [The OSD/OS image](https://github.com/mehmetraif/OSD-OS/wiki/The-OSD-OS-Image#building-the-image-yourself).
