# Troubleshooting

What to do when something doesn't work. First where OSD/OS writes its log and how to read it, then the usual problems, sorted by what you see, each with its cause and its fix. Most answers end in a line of the log, so start there.

## Where the log is

OSD/OS writes what it has to say to its standard output and standard error, one line per event. Where that goes depends on how it was started:

| How OSD/OS runs | Where the log goes | How to read it |
|---|---|---|
| The [OSD/OS image](https://github.com/mehmetraif/OSD-OS/wiki/The-OSD-OS-Image), or `install.sh`'s autostart service | The systemd journal | `journalctl -u osdos -b` (this boot), `journalctl -u osdos -f` (as it happens) |
| `osdos` typed in a shell (SSH, or Exit to Terminal) | That shell | Read it there, or keep it: `osdos 2>&1 \| tee ~/osdos.log` |
| A build from source | The terminal it runs in | `APP_ROOT=$(pwd) ./build/osdos` |
| The Mac app opened from the Finder | macOS's log | Console.app, or run `/Applications/osdos.app/Contents/MacOS/osdos` in Terminal |
| The AppImage | The terminal it was started from | `./OSD-OS-linux-x86_64.AppImage` |

On the image, the user OSD/OS runs as (`pi`) is in the `adm` group, so `journalctl` needs no `sudo`.

**When the Pi switches itself off.** Under the autostart service, quitting OSD/OS powers the Pi off, and so does OSD/OS ending with an error: the service's stop helper, `osdos-stop`, powers off for every exit code it doesn't know, which leaves no screen to read. Two ways round it:

- If the system keeps its journal from one boot to the next, `journalctl -u osdos -b -1` shows the boot before. `journalctl --list-boots` says which boots it has.
- Run OSD/OS by hand instead of through the service. Stop the service, then start the launcher in your shell; quitting it then returns to the shell and leaves the Pi on ([BUILDING.md → Debugging & logs](https://github.com/mehmetraif/OSD-OS/blob/main/BUILDING.md#debugging--logs)):

  ```sh
  sudo systemctl stop osdos
  osdos 2>&1 | tee ~/osdos.log
  ```

  Settings → Quit → **Exit to Terminal** does the first half without `sudo`: it ends the app and leaves a login shell on the TV, where `osdos` starts it again by hand. From that shell, `sudo systemctl start osdos` (or a reboot) brings the service back. An image built without a password has no `sudo` ([The user, its password and sudo](https://github.com/mehmetraif/OSD-OS/wiki/The-OSD-OS-Image#the-user-its-password-and-sudo)); switching the Pi off and on brings the service back there.

### mpv's own log

The player's messages reach OSD/OS's log as `[mpv] …` lines, with every token blanked out. mpv also writes a complete, verbose log of the latest video to `/tmp/osdos-mpv.log` (the system's temporary folder; on a Mac, `$TMPDIR`). mpv starts the file afresh for each video, so copy it before playing the next one. It is readable by its owner only: it holds each video's full address, and a media server's token with it. Look through it before you post it anywhere.

### What a build from source adds

A Release build (every release, and the image) leaves out OSD/OS's debug lines (CMake passes `-DQT_NO_DEBUG_OUTPUT`). A build configured without `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release` keeps them: `[main] dataRoot = …` at start, `[AppCore] Loaded manifest: com.osdos.youtube` for each module, `[AppCore] Setting saved: app.video_scaling = 14:9` at each change, and `[MpvController] launch: mpv …`, each video's full command line with the tokens blanked out. To see why something goes wrong, a build from source is often the quickest way ([Building from source](https://github.com/mehmetraif/OSD-OS/wiki/Building-from-Source)).

### Qt's own switches

When the screens themselves misbehave, three environment variables make Qt say more ([BUILDING.md → Qt / QML debugging knobs](https://github.com/mehmetraif/OSD-OS/blob/main/BUILDING.md#qt--qml-debugging-knobs)):

```sh
QT_LOGGING_RULES="qt.qml.*=true"   # verbose QML engine logging
QML_IMPORT_TRACE=1                 # how each QML import is found, or not
QT_QPA_EGLFS_DEBUG=1               # the KMS/DRM output, on a Pi without a desktop
```

Put them in front of the command (`QML_IMPORT_TRACE=1 APP_ROOT=$(pwd) ./build/osdos`). For the service, add them with a drop-in, `sudo systemctl edit osdos`:

```ini
[Service]
Environment=QML_IMPORT_TRACE=1
```

then `sudo systemctl restart osdos` and read `journalctl -u osdos -b`. To take it out again, `sudo systemctl edit osdos` once more and delete the line. (Not `systemctl revert`: on the image it would take away the image's own drop-ins for the service too.)

## Reading the log

Every line OSD/OS writes starts with the part it comes from, in brackets. Lines from the screens themselves (QML) start with `qml:`. A Release build's start on a Linux PC (a virtual 640×480 screen, no Bluetooth), then Local Files opened:

```text
[main] display index 0: "screen" 640x480 at (0,0)
[main] UI target display index 0 -> 640x480 at (0,0)
[NfcReader] Polling disabled by configuration
[MpvController] video profile: generic
[input] SDL game-controller subsystem ready
[input] no Consumer Control device found, remote's extra buttons (if any) won't be remappable
[Bluetooth] No system bus: Failed to connect to socket /run/dbus/system_bus_socket: No such file or directory
[boot] first frame 166 ms after start
qml: Routing to: modules/local_files/views/Root.qml
```

| Prefix | Part of OSD/OS | What it writes |
|---|---|---|
| `[main]` | Start-up | Each screen it found (`display index 0: "…" 720x480 at (0,0)`) and the one it uses, a `display_index` out of range, a stop by a signal, and `QML engine failed to load Main.qml` when the screens can't load at all. A build from source adds `appRoot` and `dataRoot` |
| `[AppCore]` | The shell: modules, settings, themes, skins | A `manifest.json` that isn't JSON or lacks `id` or `entry_point_qml`, each theme and skin read and what in it can't be used, a setting that couldn't be saved, a custom color scheme that is wrong. A build from source adds every module loaded, enabled or disabled, and every setting saved |
| `[MpvController]` | Playback | The video profile chosen at start (`video profile: Pi 4 — drm + drm-copy,v4l2m2m-copy`), `mpv not found`, mpv's exit code when it isn't 0, `WATCHDOG: no IPC time-pos event for N s — possible freeze`, the screen held by something else, a logo picture it couldn't read |
| `[mpv]` | mpv's own output | Why a file won't open, an option it refuses |
| `[EmbeddedMpv]` | Transparent Background (libmpv inside the window) | Whether libmpv was found (`using libmpv.so.2`, or `libmpv not found: Transparent Background is unavailable`), where the pictures are drawn (`pictures drawn on the GPU: <renderer>`, or by mpv's software renderer), an option this libmpv doesn't know, a GPU that can't take the decoder's frames |
| `[DisplayHandoff]` | A Pi without a desktop handing its screen to mpv, a takeover script or a web player, and taking it back (VTs, DRM) | A VT that couldn't be switched, DRM master or the CRTC that couldn't be saved or restored: the lines behind a black screen after a video |
| `[DisplayOutput]` | Settings → Display Output | The switch asked for, and an output not kept |
| `[AudioOutput]` | Settings → Audio Output | `Sound through <card>` at start and at each change |
| `[MenuMusic]` | The menu music | What it plays, what it makes into a WAV first, and why a file can't play |
| `[Bluetooth]` | Settings → Bluetooth | No system bus (D-Bus), the pairing agent, an adapter that wouldn't power on |
| `[input]` | Gamepads and remotes | SDL ready or failed, controllers added and removed, `input.cfg` lines ignored (with their line number) and the bindings applied, `gamecontrollerdb.txt` mappings loaded, a remote's Consumer Control device |
| `[boot]` | The image's boot screen | The first frame's time, each held-back service settling, the boot screen closing |
| `[legacy]` | Moving over from 240-MP | 240-MP's data folder moved over, module ids renamed |
| `[AtomicFile]` | Saving state | `Could not write <path>: <reason>`: a file left as it was, never half written |
| `[LocalFiles]` | Local Files | A folder not found, USB drives in and out |
| `[Scripts]` | Scripts | Each run, how it ended and its exit code, sidecar lines it couldn't read, a takeover run in console mode |
| `[NfcReader]` | NFC Reader | Readers found and lost, polling started or disabled, tag files skipped or created |
| `[Weather]` | Weather | The place it resolved, forecasts fetched or not, the US stations it reads, its music |
| `[AmbientMode]` | Ambient:Mode | mpv not found for its music |
| `[Playlists]` | Playlists | A download that failed and why, a listing that failed, `playlists.json` not written |
| `[PlexBackend]`, `[Plex]`, `[PlexAuth]` | Plex | Token refreshes, a device no longer authorized, profile PINs, a queue cut short |
| `[JellyfinBackend]`, `[Jellyfin]` | Jellyfin | Quick Connect's HTTP errors, a token the server rejected, playback reports that failed |
| `[EmbyBackend]`, `[Emby]` | Emby | The same for Emby, and Dolby Vision sources transcoded |
| `[WebPlayer]` | Netflix, Prime Video, YouTube's sign-in | Signing out, and refusing to while the browser is open |
| `[TMDB]` | Netflix's and Prime Video's catalogue | A request to TMDB that failed |
| `qml:` | The screens | `qml: [Effect] … can't be used`, `qml: Routing to: modules/…/Root.qml` as a module opens, a module screen's error (`qml: [Jellyfin Items] Error: …`). Qt's own QML errors name the file and the line |

## A module is missing from the main menu

Most modules come switched off. Only Local Files and Playlists are on at first; Ambient:Mode, Emby, Jellyfin, Netflix, NFC Reader, Plex, Prime Video, Scripts, Weather and YouTube each have an **Enabled** setting that starts at Off. Turn it on in Settings → *the module's name* → Enabled, and the module joins the main menu. With every module off, the main menu says **No modules enabled**.

## Black screen or no picture

| Cause | Fix |
|---|---|
| Settings → Display Output switched to an output the TV doesn't show | Wait: 15 seconds after OSD/OS starts on the new output without **Keep**, it goes back to the old one by itself and restarts again |
| Nothing at all, even after that | Take the card to a computer and copy `osdos-display-hdmi.txt` (or an output you know works) over `osdos-display.txt` on the **bootfs** drive |
| A Pi 4 on composite or SCART RGB, and HDMI went dark | As it should be: a Pi 4 has one output on at a time |
| An app install on Raspberry Pi OS, a CRT showing nothing | Raspberry Pi OS's own `config.txt` drives HDMI. Composite needs `enable_tvout=1`, `sdtv_mode` and `sdtv_aspect`, and OSD/OS's video settings expect fake KMS on a Pi 3 or 4 (`dtoverlay=vc4-fkms-v3d,cma-256`): use the composite `config.txt` in [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/mehmetraif/OSD-OS/blob/main/INSTALL.md) ([Installation](https://github.com/mehmetraif/OSD-OS/wiki/Installation)) |
| The picture comes, but the menus run off the edges of a CRT | `config.txt` keeps `disable_overscan=1`, so the Pi adds no border, and OSD/OS keeps its menus inside a safe area that suits most tubes. A TV that hides more than most cuts into it ([Overscan and the safe area](https://github.com/mehmetraif/OSD-OS/wiki/Display-Output#overscan-and-the-safe-area)) |
| Black after a video, the sound still going or the menus never coming back | `[DisplayHandoff]` lines in the log say which step of giving the screen back failed. A `mpv_video_args` of your own in `config.json` can draw where the menus can't come back from: take it out ([Playback and mpv](https://github.com/mehmetraif/OSD-OS/wiki/Playback-and-mpv)) |
| Black at start, and the Pi switches off | OSD/OS failed to start: see [The app won't start](#the-app-wont-start) |

[Display Output → Troubleshooting a black screen](https://github.com/mehmetraif/OSD-OS/wiki/Display-Output#troubleshooting-a-black-screen) goes through every output, SCART's pins and a Pi 5's connectors.

## A video won't play

The loading screen comes, then the menu again, or an error. The log says which of these it is:

| What the log says | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `[MpvController] mpv not found (no bundled sibling, none on PATH)` | mpv isn't installed, or isn't on the `PATH` of the user OSD/OS runs as | `sudo apt install mpv` (Raspberry Pi OS), `brew install mpv` (macOS). The AppImage carries its own |
| `Error parsing option subs-with-matching-audio (option parameter could not be parsed)`, then `[mpv] Setting commandline option --subs-with-matching-audio=forced failed.` and `[MpvController] mpv exited with code 1` | mpv is older than 0.38. OSD/OS asks for forced subtitles only (`--subs-with-matching-audio=forced`), which came with mpv 0.38. Local Files, NFC Reader and Playlists ask for it by default (their subtitle setting's Forced Only), Ambient:Mode always, Plex for a transcode or Live TV | A newer mpv. Raspberry Pi OS Trixie has 0.40 and Homebrew a current one; Ubuntu 24.04 has 0.37 and 22.04 0.34.1. `scripts/build-mpv.sh` builds 0.40 ([Building from source](https://github.com/mehmetraif/OSD-OS/wiki/Building-from-Source#the-appimage-and-mpv-038)); OSD/OS takes an `mpv` next to its own binary before the one on the `PATH` |
| `[mpv] …` lines about the file, then `mpv exited with code 2` | mpv couldn't play the file: a codec it can't decode, a file cut short, a stream refused. It reaches the module as `failed`; Plex then tries again with a transcode | Play the same file with `mpv <file>` in a terminal: if mpv can't either, the file is the problem. The full story is in `/tmp/osdos-mpv.log` |
| `[MpvController] Cannot start playback: <owner> has the screen` | Something else holds the Pi's screen: a takeover script, a web player | Let it finish, or stop it |
| `[MpvController] WATCHDOG: no IPC time-pos event for N s — possible freeze` | mpv stopped moving: a stream stalled, a drive gone | A network share or a USB drive pulled out while it played reads as this. mpv's log says what it was waiting for |
| Nothing from mpv, and Transparent Background is on | The video plays inside the window through libmpv, which logs as `[EmbeddedMpv]` | Its lines say whether libmpv loaded and where it draws. Turn Transparent Background off (select on the row) to compare with an mpv process |

## Judder or stutter

| Cause | Fix |
|---|---|
| An `mpv_video_args` override in `config.json` | OSD/OS picks the decoder and the output for each board itself. On a Pi 4 it draws on the primary plane (`--vo=drm --hwdec=drm-copy,v4l2m2m-copy`), because the zero-copy overlay path jitters into visible judder with 24 fps films. Take the override out of `"app"` and compare ([Playback and mpv](https://github.com/mehmetraif/OSD-OS/wiki/Playback-and-mpv)) |
| A Pi 3 with Settings → 1080p Playback **Off** | Off lets crop, 14:9 and Pan & Scan work, but 1080p stutters on the copy path. Keep the films to 720p, or turn it back **On** (smooth 1080p, no crop) |
| A film the board can't decode in hardware | A Pi 4 plays 1080p HEVC at about half its CPU, but not 4K HEVC. On YouTube, keep **Video Codec** at H.264 (a Pi decodes it in hardware) and set **Max Frame Rate** to 30; **Any** often picks VP9 or AV1, decoded in software |
| Transparent Background drawing on the CPU | The log says `pictures drawn by mpv's software renderer` when Qt doesn't draw with OpenGL. `pictures drawn on the GPU: …` is the light way |
| A 24 fps film on a 50 or 60 Hz output | Frames can't be shown for equal times there, on any player: OSD/OS doesn't change the output's rate for a film |

## No sound

1. **Choose the card** in Settings → Audio Output: AV Jack, HDMI or a USB sound card. On **Auto**, sound goes to ALSA's first card, which may not be the one plugged in. A Pi 5 has no AV jack: use HDMI, or a USB sound card on a CRT.
2. **See the cards ALSA has**: `aplay -l`, or `cat /proc/asound/cards`, the card's id in brackets.
3. **Quiet AV jack**: `amixer sset PCM 100%`, then `sudo alsactl store` to keep it.
4. **Read the log**: `journalctl -b -u osdos | grep AudioOutput` shows `Sound through <card>`. mpv's own log, `/tmp/osdos-mpv.log`, says why a video's sound couldn't open.

No Audio Output row at all means a sound server (PipeWire, PulseAudio) runs, as on a desktop: choose the output in the system's sound settings there. [Audio Output → When there is no sound](https://github.com/mehmetraif/OSD-OS/wiki/Audio-Output#when-there-is-no-sound) has the rest, and [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/mehmetraif/OSD-OS/blob/main/INSTALL.md) the ALSA settings outside the app (`/etc/asound.conf`, `audio-device=` in `mpv.conf`).

## YouTube

YouTube runs through yt-dlp: the module searches and lists playlists with it, and mpv's ytdl hook finds each video's streams with it. A problem shows in the help line at the foot of the tree:

| What the help line says | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| **Searching needs yt-dlp, which is not installed** | No yt-dlp where OSD/OS looks: `bin/yt-dlp` in the data folder first, then beside its binary, then the `PATH` | Install it ([BUILDING.md](https://github.com/mehmetraif/OSD-OS/blob/main/BUILDING.md#raspberry-pi-os-arm64)). On the AppImage, put it at `~/.local/share/OSD-OS/bin/yt-dlp` and `chmod +x` it |
| **Could not search YouTube: check the network, and that yt-dlp is up to date** | No network, or a yt-dlp too old for YouTube's latest changes | Update it (below) |
| **Could not load the playlists: check the network, and that yt-dlp is installed** | The same, for `youtube_playlists.txt` | The same |
| **Could not load the subscriptions: check the network** | The channels' feeds didn't come | Check the network, and the channel ids in `youtube_subscriptions.txt` |

**Updating yt-dlp.** A yt-dlp a few weeks old soon stops finding videos.

- The image keeps its own, yt-dlp's nightly build, at `/home/pi/.local/share/OSD-OS/bin/yt-dlp`, and updates it two minutes after each boot and once a day (`osdos-yt-dlp-update.timer`). `journalctl -u osdos-yt-dlp-update` shows how the last update went; `~/.local/share/OSD-OS/bin/yt-dlp --update` updates it now.
- An install made by hand: `sudo yt-dlp -U` for the copy in `/usr/local/bin` from [BUILDING.md](https://github.com/mehmetraif/OSD-OS/blob/main/BUILDING.md#raspberry-pi-os-arm64), `brew upgrade yt-dlp` on a Mac.

**Deno.** Current yt-dlp needs a JavaScript runtime to answer YouTube's challenges; without one, a video plays in few formats or none. Deno is the recommended one ([yt-dlp's EJS notes](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/EJS)). It must be on the `PATH` of the user, or the systemd service, that runs OSD/OS: a service's `PATH` holds `/usr/local/bin` and the system's folders, not a folder in your home. The image has it in `/usr/local/bin`; `brew install deno` on a Mac.

**"Sign in to confirm you're not a bot".** With yt-dlp current and Deno found, YouTube can still ask this of an address. Two things help:

- **Sign in**: YouTube's settings → **Sign in** opens Google's sign-in page full screen, in Chromium (with `cage` and `wtype` without a desktop) or Google Chrome on a Mac. yt-dlp then searches and plays as that account, which YouTube asks for fewer checks. YouTube can block an account used through yt-dlp, so sign in with a spare one. **Sign out** forgets it.
- **Compare IPv4 and IPv6.** The check can belong to the route. On a system that already has IPv6, compare the two ([BUILDING.md](https://github.com/mehmetraif/OSD-OS/blob/main/BUILDING.md#raspberry-pi-os-arm64)):

  ```sh
  yt-dlp --verbose --simulate --force-ipv4 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID'
  yt-dlp --verbose --simulate --force-ipv6 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID'
  ```

  If IPv4 gets the check and IPv6 doesn't, the cause is the IPv4 route, not yt-dlp. OSD/OS doesn't turn IPv6 on, or need it: that is the network's business.

More in [YouTube](https://github.com/mehmetraif/OSD-OS/wiki/YouTube).

## Netflix and Prime Video

The catalogue comes from TMDB, and a title plays in the service's own web player, in Chromium with Widevine.

| What you see | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| **No TMDB API key: put one in tmdb_api_key.txt in the data folder (free from themoviedb.org, Settings, API)** | No key | Put a TMDB API key on the first line of `tmdb_api_key.txt` in the data folder: a v3 key, or a v4 read access token (which starts `eyJ`) |
| **TMDB turned the API key down: check tmdb_api_key.txt** | TMDB answered 401 | A key copied short, or with something else on its line |
| **Could not reach TMDB: check the network** | No network, or TMDB unreachable; the log has the `[TMDB]` line | Check the network |
| **Chromium is not installed** | None of `chromium`, `chromium-browser`, `google-chrome-stable`, `google-chrome` on the `PATH` | `sudo apt install chromium libwidevinecdm0` (Raspberry Pi OS; the image has it) |
| **cage is not installed** | No desktop, and no kiosk compositor to give the browser a screen | `sudo apt install cage wtype` |
| **Google Chrome is not installed** (a Mac, YouTube's sign-in) | YouTube's sign-in needs Chrome on a Mac, whose sign-in yt-dlp can read | Install Google Chrome |
| The service's page says it can't play protected video | No Widevine | `sudo apt install libwidevinecdm0` |
| The sign-in is gone next time | The browser was stopped before it saved its cookies: Chromium writes them only every half minute. Holding back closes it the way Ctrl+W does, through `wtype`; without `wtype`, with a `cage` older than 0.1.5, or on a desktop, the run is stopped instead | Install `wtype`, or wait half a minute after signing in before you leave |
| Back does nothing in the browser | Back has to be held for two seconds there, and only Escape counts (a gamepad's back button arrives as Escape), not Backspace, which the browser's text fields need | Hold back for two seconds, or close the browser with Ctrl+W |

More in [Netflix and Prime Video](https://github.com/mehmetraif/OSD-OS/wiki/Netflix-and-Prime-Video).

## Plex, Jellyfin and Emby

| What you see | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Plex: a code, **Visit plex.tv/link and enter the code above** | Not signed in yet | Type the code at plex.tv/link with any browser, signed in to your Plex account |
| Plex: the Server, Current User and Libraries settings are missing | They only show once the module is signed in | Open Plex and sign in first |
| Plex asks for a profile's PIN | The Plex Home profile has a PIN | Type it. A card tapped on the NFC Reader never switches profile, and never asks for a PIN |
| Plex asks to sign in again | `[PlexBackend] Device no longer authorized — triggering reauth`: plex.tv answered 401, as for a device removed from the account's authorized devices | Sign in again |
| Jellyfin: **QUICK CONNECT NOT ENABLED ON SERVER** | The server answered 401 to Quick Connect | Turn Quick Connect on in the Jellyfin server's settings, then enter the code at `<server>/web/#quickconnect` |
| Jellyfin or Emby: **CONNECTION FAILED: …**, or nothing | The server URL: OSD/OS takes it as typed, so it needs the scheme and the port (`http://192.168.1.20:8096`) | Type the whole URL. A self-signed or private certificate on your own server is accepted for that server; an expired one isn't |
| Signed out by itself | `Token rejected — signing out` in the log: the server no longer knows the token (a password changed, the device removed) | Sign in again |
| A Plex film fails, then plays after a while | Plex retries with a transcode when mpv can't play the file directly | Set Settings → Plex → Video Quality to one of its Mbps choices instead of Direct Play, or read the server's log for why the stream failed |
| **Not Allowed** on an offline playlist's video | The Jellyfin or Emby user may not download | Allow downloads for that user on the server, then Retry Downloads |

Each module's settings has **Sign out**. The sign-ins are kept in the data folder: `plex_auth.json` (with `plex_key.pem`), `jellyfin_auth.json`, `emby_auth.json`. More in [Plex](https://github.com/mehmetraif/OSD-OS/wiki/Plex), [Jellyfin](https://github.com/mehmetraif/OSD-OS/wiki/Jellyfin) and [Emby](https://github.com/mehmetraif/OSD-OS/wiki/Emby).

## Bluetooth won't turn on

Settings → Bluetooth tries a second time two seconds after BlueZ refuses (bluetoothd may still be setting the adapter up). After a second refusal its help line says why, **Couldn't turn Bluetooth on: …**, and a **Details** line appears: what BlueZ says about the adapter, the rfkill switches, and the system log's last Bluetooth lines, made to be photographed.

| The message ends in | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| **rfkill blocks it** | A software block: Raspberry Pi OS starts every radio blocked, and unblocks Bluetooth only on some adapters | The image unblocks it as bluetoothd starts. On an app install: `sudo rfkill unblock bluetooth`; systemd keeps it from one boot to the next. `rfkill list bluetooth` shows the switches |
| **a switch blocks it (rfkill)** | A hard block: a switch or the firmware, not software | Nothing in software lifts it |
| anything else | BlueZ's own answer | Read Details, and `journalctl -u bluetooth -b` |

**No Bluetooth** on the page means BlueZ isn't running or there is no adapter. No Bluetooth row in Settings means a Mac (pair devices in macOS's own settings) or a build without Qt D-Bus. On Linux, the user OSD/OS runs as must be in the `bluetooth` group (`sudo usermod -aG bluetooth $USER`, then log in again); `install.sh` and the image do this.

## Wi-Fi on the image

There is no Wi-Fi setting in OSD/OS: the network is NetworkManager's. The boot screen's last line, **ONLINE**, is the check that the network is up; with no network it ends with `[FAIL]` after 20 seconds, and OSD/OS carries on without it.

- **Before the first boot**: set Wi-Fi in Raspberry Pi Imager through a local manifest (Imager 2 skips its customisation for an image chosen with **Use custom**), or in `network-config` on the **bootfs** drive ([Installation → Wi-Fi by hand](https://github.com/mehmetraif/OSD-OS/wiki/Installation#wi-fi-by-hand-network-config)). cloud-init reads it on the first boot only.
- **After the first boot**, from a shell (Exit to Terminal, or SSH over Ethernet): `sudo raspi-config`, or NetworkManager's own tool:

  ```sh
  sudo nmcli device wifi connect "MyHomeWiFi" password "my-wifi-password"
  ```

  Both need `sudo`, so an image built with a password.
- Wi-Fi stays off until its country is set: Imager's customisation and `network-config`'s `regulatory-domain` set it.

Settings shows the Pi's IP address at the right end of its title bar once there is one. More in [The OSD/OS image → Wi-Fi](https://github.com/mehmetraif/OSD-OS/wiki/The-OSD-OS-Image#wi-fi).

## A USB drive doesn't show

Local Files lists a drive as `USB: <label>`, after Recently Watched, Favorites and Search.

| Where | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| The image | A file system it doesn't mount, a partition already mounted, or the disk the system boots from | `journalctl -u 'osdos-usb-mount@*'` says what each drive was mounted as, or why not. It mounts FAT32, exFAT, NTFS, ext2/3/4, HFS+, XFS, btrfs, F2FS, ISO 9660 and UDF, read-only, under `/media/usb/<label>` |
| An app install on Raspberry Pi OS Lite | Raspberry Pi OS Lite mounts nothing by itself | Mount it under `/media`: OSD/OS lists a block device mounted under `/media/` or `/run/media/`, named after its mount point's folder |
| Any | The drive is mounted by `/etc/fstab`, holds the media folder, or is inside it | Those are left out of the list on purpose: the tree shows the media folder already |
| A Mac | Not mounted | It lists what is mounted under `/Volumes` |

A video of a drive that was pulled out drops out of Recently Watched and Favorites until the drive is back.

## The films partition (the image)

| What you see | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| No **OSD-OS** drive on the card | The first boot splits the card: the system keeps 8 GiB and the rest becomes the exFAT **OSD-OS** partition. A card with less than 2 GiB to spare gets none | Use a bigger card |
| Windows offers to format a drive | It can't read the system's partition | Always **Cancel**: formatting it erases the system |
| Films copied on, not in Local Files | Local Files opens `/media/OSD-OS` only until its Media Directory names another folder | Settings → Local Files → Media Directory → Default Folder |
| Offline playlists fail, naming the folder | A card flashed with an earlier image mounts the partition read-only (`ro` in `/etc/fstab`, its line naming `/media/240-MP`) | Flash the new image, or change `ro` to `rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev` and the line's last `0` to `2` |
| Files on it untidy after the power was cut | A download half written | It is checked with `fsck.exfat` at every boot before it is mounted |

## A theme or skin isn't listed, or is partly ignored

`AppCore` reads themes from `assets/themes` and the data folder's `themes`, skins from `assets/skins` and the data folder's `skins`, and says in the log what it couldn't use. A run with a few mistakes in a theme and a skin of one's own:

```text
[AppCore] /home/pi/.local/share/OSD-OS/themes/broken/theme.json: object is missing after a comma
[AppCore] theme mine: its colors are not a color scheme's name or a #rrggbb primary and surface: drawn in Video 1's
[AppCore] theme mine: its background effect's area is not "window" or "foot": the window
[AppCore] theme mine: its background shader, "fire.qsb", is not a qsb file in its folder
[AppCore] theme mine: its screen effect's glow is not a number from 0 to 1: none
[AppCore] theme mine: its music, "../outside.ogg", is not a ogg/opus/mp3/flac/wav/m4a/aac/mid/midi/xm/mod/s3m/it file in its folder
[AppCore] theme mine: /home/pi/.local/share/OSD-OS/themes/mine
[AppCore] skin myskin: its window, "window.png", is not a png/gif/bmp file in its folder
[AppCore] skin myskin: "My Icon!" is not an icon's name
[AppCore] skin myskin: /home/pi/.local/share/OSD-OS/skins/myskin
```

| What you see | Why |
|---|---|
| Not in Settings → Theme at all | Its `theme.json` isn't JSON (the first line above, written when Settings lists the themes), or it isn't in a folder of its own under `themes` |
| Listed by its folder's name | Its `name` is missing, or longer than 28 characters |
| A built-in theme gone | A theme in the data folder with the same folder name takes its place |
| A `theme.json` in the data folder's `themes` listed under Skin instead | It holds only window pictures (`window`, `titleBar`, `hintBar`, `selection`): a skin from before skins had a folder of their own |
| A part drawn as none | That part couldn't be used, and the line says why: colours become Video 1's, a skin OSD/OS's own window, an effect nothing |
| A file "not in its folder" | Every file must be inside the theme's or skin's own folder: a path or a link out of it is refused. A skin's pictures must be PNG, GIF or BMP, its icons PNG, SVG, GIF, BMP or JPEG named in `a-z`, `0-9`, `_` and `-` |
| A number above 1 doing no more than 1 | Effect numbers are held between 0 and 1: `2` is drawn as 1, without a line in the log |

The format is in [Themes](https://github.com/mehmetraif/OSD-OS/wiki/Themes) and [Skins](https://github.com/mehmetraif/OSD-OS/wiki/Skins).

## A shader "can't be used"

A theme's own shader must be a `.qsb` that Qt Shader Tools' `qsb` compiled, for every graphics API Qt may draw with. One that isn't is replaced, and Qt and OSD/OS say so:

```text
ShaderEffect: Failed to deserialize QShader from /home/pi/.local/share/OSD-OS/themes/tube/tube.qsb. Either the filename is incorrect, or it is not a valid .qsb file. …
qml: [Effect] file:///home/pi/.local/share/OSD-OS/themes/tube/tube.qsb can't be used, OSD/OS's own in its place
```

A screen shader of a theme's own gives way to OSD/OS's, with the theme's numbers; OSD/OS's own failing leaves none (`…, none`). A background shader that can't be used is logged the same way and the background stays empty. Compile it again, with a Qt no newer than the one OSD/OS runs on (a newer Qt's `.qsb` may not load in an older one), as the [theme template](https://github.com/mehmetraif/OSD-OS/tree/main/docs/theme-template) does:

```sh
qsb --glsl "100 es,120,150" --hlsl 50 --msl 12 -o plasma.frag.qsb plasma.frag
```

`qsb` comes with Qt Shader Tools: `sudo apt install qt6-shader-baker` on Debian and Raspberry Pi OS (`/usr/lib/qt6/bin/qsb`), or the `bin` folder of a Qt from Qt's installer. More in [Shaders](https://github.com/mehmetraif/OSD-OS/wiki/Shaders).

## No menu music

The menu music plays only in the menus: never while a video plays, loads or has its menu open, never under the boot screen, the screen saver or Weather's and Ambient:Mode's own music, and only 700 ms after nothing else holds it. Settings → Menu Music must be the theme's (and the theme have music) or **File** with a Music File, and Music Volume above QUIET. Then the log says the rest:

| What the log says | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `[MenuMusic] playing <file>` | It plays: check the sound card (Settings → Audio Output; the menu music follows it) | |
| `[MenuMusic] <file>: a MIDI file needs FluidSynth and a SoundFont: fluidsynth is not installed` | A MIDI file, made into a WAV first, and no FluidSynth | `sudo apt install fluidsynth timgm6mb-soundfont` (`install.sh` and the image have them); `brew install fluid-synth` on a Mac |
| `… needs FluidSynth and a SoundFont: no SoundFont found` | No General MIDI SoundFont | A `.sf2` beside the MIDI file with its name, or in the data folder's `soundfonts`, or the system's (`timgm6mb-soundfont`). Homebrew's FluidSynth brings none |
| `[MenuMusic] mpv couldn't play <file>, and openmpt123 is not installed` | A tracker's module (XM, MOD, S3M, IT) this mpv can't play | `sudo apt install openmpt123`; `brew install libopenmpt` on a Mac |
| `[MenuMusic] mpv couldn't play <file> (exit N)` | mpv ended within three seconds | The file is damaged or of a kind mpv can't play. It isn't tried again until the music changes |
| `[MenuMusic] <file>: no such file` | The file moved | Pick it again in Settings → Music File |
| `[MenuMusic] mpv not found: no menu music` | No mpv | Install mpv |

The menu music's mpv starts with `--no-config`: nothing in `mpv.conf` reaches it. More in [Menu music](https://github.com/mehmetraif/OSD-OS/wiki/Menu-Music).

## Rows missing in Settings

Settings offers a row only where it can work:

| Row | Offered when |
|---|---|
| Text Effect, Background Effect, Screen Effect | The build has OSD/OS's shaders (Qt Shader Tools at build time) and Qt draws on a GPU, not with its software renderer |
| Ripple, Wave and Drop among the Transitions | The same; without them a theme's Ripple, Wave or Drop fades instead |
| Selector Effect, and Fade and the Cubes | Always: they need no shader |
| Transparent Background | libmpv was found at run time (`libmpv2` on Raspberry Pi OS, part of Homebrew's mpv), and the build has libmpv's headers. The log says `[EmbeddedMpv] libmpv not found: Transparent Background is unavailable` |
| Display Output | The OSD/OS image, OSD/OS started by its service, and more than one output for this board |
| Audio Output | Linux with ALSA's cards (`/proc/asound/cards`) and no sound server |
| Bluetooth | Linux, a build with Qt D-Bus |
| 1080p Playback | A Raspberry Pi 3, whose smooth path can't crop |
| Window Frame | OSD Background is Window |
| Music File, Music Volume | Menu Music is File; Menu Music isn't Off |
| Logo Image | Channel Logo isn't Off |
| Startup From | A favourite is set to Play at Startup |

A build without Qt Shader Tools says so when CMake configures it: `Qt Shader Tools not found — the shader effects will be unavailable` ([Building from source](https://github.com/mehmetraif/OSD-OS/wiki/Building-from-Source#qt-shader-tools)). Under Qt's software renderer (`QT_QUICK_BACKEND=software`) the shaders can't run whatever the build; OpenGL drawn on the CPU (Mesa's llvmpipe) still runs them, slowly. More in [Effects](https://github.com/mehmetraif/OSD-OS/wiki/Effects).

## The app won't start

| What the log says | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `QQmlApplicationEngine failed to load component`, `…/Main.qml: No such file or directory`, then `[main] QML engine failed to load Main.qml` | OSD/OS's own files aren't where it looks: `APP_ROOT`, else `share/osdos` beside the binary's folder, else the folder above it | From source, start it with `APP_ROOT=$(pwd)` in the repository's folder |
| `module "QtQuick.Effects" is not installed` (the Weather and NFC Reader screens), or another `module "…" is not installed` | A QML module missing | Raspberry Pi OS and Debian: `sudo apt install qml6-module-qtquick qml6-module-qtquick-controls qml6-module-qtquick-window qml6-module-qtquick-effects` (`install.sh` installs them). QtQuick.Effects came with Qt 6.5, so Qt 6.4 (Ubuntu 24.04's) can't open those two modules. `QML_IMPORT_TRACE=1` shows where Qt looked |
| `This application failed to start because no Qt platform plugin could be initialized.` | Qt's platform plugin missing, or the wrong one asked for | Without a desktop, OSD/OS draws with EGLFS (`QT_QPA_PLATFORM=eglfs`, which the launcher sets); on a desktop, `xcb` or `wayland`. The AppImage carries only `xcb`: it needs X11, or Wayland with XWayland |
| EGLFS errors about the DRM device, such as `drmModeGetResources failed` | On a Pi 5 the GPU's render node can come before the display's card, and Qt takes the wrong one | The launcher (`/usr/local/bin/osdos`) picks the card with a display; `scripts/rpi-run-local.sh` does the same for a build of your own |
| Nothing on screen when started over SSH | The service holds the screen | `sudo systemctl stop osdos` first |
| macOS: it won't open | A release that isn't notarized | System Settings → Privacy & Security → **Open Anyway**, or `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/osdos.app` |
| The AppImage: ``version `GLIBC_2.39' not found`` | It is built on Ubuntu 24.04, which sets its glibc floor at 2.39 | A newer distribution (a current Steam Deck, Ubuntu 24.04 and later), or build it on yours ([Building from source](https://github.com/mehmetraif/OSD-OS/wiki/Building-from-Source#the-appimage-and-mpv-038)) |
| A gamepad does nothing | `[input]` lines: SDL failed, the controller not found, `input.cfg` lines ignored | On Linux the user must be in the `input` group (`sudo usermod -aG input $USER`, then reboot) ([Controls](https://github.com/mehmetraif/OSD-OS/wiki/Controls)) |

## Resetting settings

Every setting is in `config.json` in the data folder, under `"app"` for OSD/OS's own and `"modules"` for each module's ([Configuration files](https://github.com/mehmetraif/OSD-OS/wiki/Configuration-Files)):

| System | Data folder |
|---|---|
| The OSD/OS image | `/home/pi/.local/share/OSD-OS/` |
| Raspberry Pi OS, other Linux, the AppImage | `~/.local/share/OSD-OS/` (`$XDG_DATA_HOME/OSD-OS/` when it is set) |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/OSD-OS/` |
| Any, with `DATA_ROOT` set | That folder |

To start from the defaults, quit OSD/OS (it reads `config.json` as it starts and writes it at every change), move the file aside, and start it again:

```sh
cd ~/.local/share/OSD-OS
mv config.json config.json.old
```

Under the autostart service (the image, or `install.sh`'s), Quit powers the Pi off: quit with **Exit to Terminal** instead, which leaves a shell on the TV, move the file there, then `sudo systemctl start osdos`, or switch the Pi off and on.

Without `config.json`, OSD/OS starts as new and writes a fresh one at the first change. A `config.json` that isn't JSON reads as none too, and the first change then writes the defaults over it, so keep a copy before editing it by hand. To take back one setting, copy its key from `config.json.old`.

Other files hold the rest, and stay when only `config.json` goes:

| File | What it holds |
|---|---|
| `lists.json` | Each module's Recently Watched and Favorites |
| `local_files_history.json`, `youtube_history.json`, `nfc_reader_history.json` | Resume points |
| `youtube_watch_later.json`, `playlists.json` | Watch Later, and the playlists |
| `plex_auth.json`, `plex_key.pem`, `jellyfin_auth.json`, `emby_auth.json` | The media servers' sign-ins |
| `netflix/browser`, `prime_video/browser`, `youtube/browser` | The web players' browser profiles, with their sign-ins |
| `input.cfg`, `themes/`, `skins/`, `nfc_tags/`, `user_scripts/` | Your own files |

Moving the whole data folder aside starts OSD/OS as on its first day. On the image, keep `bin/yt-dlp` from it: the YouTube module's yt-dlp lives there, and its daily update runs that copy.

## How to report a bug

Open an issue at [github.com/mehmetraif/OSD-OS/issues](https://github.com/mehmetraif/OSD-OS/issues); its bug report form asks for the following. Questions and setup help go to [Discussions → Q&A](https://github.com/mehmetraif/OSD-OS/discussions/categories/q-a), and a security problem never to an issue: report it privately as [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/mehmetraif/OSD-OS/blob/main/SECURITY.md) says.

- **What you did, step by step, what you expected and what happened.**
- **The module**, or the part of the app (browsing, Settings, playback).
- **The hardware**: the board (`cat /proc/device-tree/model` on a Pi), or the Mac or PC.
- **The output**: composite NTSC or PAL, SCART RGB, HDMI; and the `config.txt` or Display Output preset in use (`cat /boot/firmware/osdos-display.txt` on the image). Overscan and `config.txt` differences are common causes.
- **How OSD/OS is installed**: the image, `install.sh`, the DMG, the AppImage, or built from source.
- **The version**: Settings shows it in its title bar, after SETTINGS (`DEV` for a build from source), and Settings → About → Build has the commit and the day the build was made.
- **mpv's version**, the first line of `mpv --version`: playback problems often come from it.
- **The log**, as text: `journalctl -u osdos -b --no-pager > osdos.log` on the image, or the terminal's output. For a playback problem, `/tmp/osdos-mpv.log` too, once you have looked through it for addresses and tokens.
- **A photo of the screen** where it helps: Settings → Bluetooth's Details page is made for one.
