# Opens a streaming service's own web player full screen, for OSD/OS's Netflix
# and Prime Video modules, and Google's sign-in for its YouTube module
# (src/modules/web_player/WebPlayerBackend.h):
#
#   web-player.sh <service> <url> [letterbox|14:9|panscan|anamorphic]
#   web-player.sh --close <service>
#
# The module runs this as a takeover: on a headless Pi the app has handed the
# screen over before this starts, and takes it back once everything this
# starts has exited. Closing the browser (Ctrl+W or Alt+F4), or holding BACK in
# OSD/OS, ends the run.
#
# Holding BACK runs --close, which closes the browser the way Ctrl+W does, so
# that it saves what it holds first: Chromium writes new cookies, a sign-in
# among them, only every half minute, and stopping it outright loses them. It
# types Ctrl+W into cage (0.1.5 or later, for its virtual keyboard) with wtype,
# and exits non-zero where it can't, for the app to stop the run instead.
#
# Needs a Chromium-based browser with Widevine, which these players require.
# On Raspberry Pi OS: `sudo apt install chromium libwidevinecdm0`, and `cage`
# to give the browser a screen when there is no desktop, with `wtype` for
# --close.
#
# The third argument is the module's Scaling setting: how a 16:9 picture fills
# a 4:3 screen (letterbox by default). Chromium only; Safari and Google Chrome
# on a Mac keep the player's own letterbox.
#
# Environment (optional):
#   OSDOS_WEB_PLAYER_UA  the browser's user agent (default: see below; its
#                        240-MP name, MP240_WEB_PLAYER_UA, still works)
