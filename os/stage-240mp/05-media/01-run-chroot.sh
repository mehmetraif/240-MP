# Runs inside the image. The film partition is mounted for the user the app runs
# as, since exFAT keeps no owners of its own; a card too small for one leaves
# the folder on the root filesystem, where it belongs to that user too. It is
# writable: films are copied onto it from a computer, and the Playlists module
# downloads its offline playlists' videos into it (flushing each one to the
# card as it completes). A Pi switched off at the wall mid-download can still
# leave it untidy, so it is checked at boot (fsck.exfat, pass 2) before it is
# mounted. nofail and the short device timeout keep a boot without it from
# waiting. It only ever holds media, and anyone can write it from a computer,
# so nothing on it can run (noexec, nosuid, nodev).
