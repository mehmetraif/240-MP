# OSD/OS

**Smart TV for CRT.** OSD/OS makes a TV, preferably a CRT, a smart TV with the look of a VCR. Flash it to an SD card, plug the Raspberry Pi into the TV, and it starts straight into OSD/OS: nothing to log in to, no desktop. Every screen is drawn like a VCR's on-screen display, in two colors and large type, and works with the arrows, select and back on a remote, a keyboard or a gamepad.

<p align="center"><img src="docs/images/default-look.gif" width="640" alt="OSD/OS as it comes: the main menu, Local Files' tree and Settings, in two colors" /></p>

Out of the box it is plain on purpose, as above: two colors, and nothing moving but the cursor. If you want more, a theme changes the whole look at once, with effects, transitions between windows and music of its own, from a tube's curved glass to Matrix rain and a fire under the window. Eight come with it:

## What it does

- **Your videos in one place**: films on the SD card or a USB drive, Plex, Jellyfin, Emby, YouTube, Netflix and Prime Video, each a module, like the inputs on a deck.
- **One way to browse**: a horizontal tree that starts with Recently Watched, Favorites and Search, typed on an on-screen keyboard.
- **Playlists** across modules, streamed, or downloaded to play without the network.
- **Transparent Background**: back from a video, the menus lie over it while it plays on.
- **Themes**, the whole look at once: the colors, the skin, effects like the ones above and the menu music. Eight come with it, and a new one is a folder.
- **Made for old TVs**: composite, SCART RGB or HDMI from Settings, 16:9 films fitted to 4:3, a channel logo in the corner, and a tape loading while a video starts.
- **And more**: a fireplace on a loop (Ambient:Mode), a 90s weather channel, NFC cards that play a film when they touch the reader, and anything a shell script can start.

The [feature list](https://github.com/mehmetraif/OSD-OS/wiki/Features) has the rest.

## Get it

- **The OSD/OS image**, the whole system for a Raspberry Pi: download `OSD-OS-<version>-raspberry-pi.img.xz` from the [latest release](https://github.com/mehmetraif/OSD-OS/releases/latest) and [flash it](os/README.md#flashing). OSD/OS is on screen from the moment the Pi is switched on, and films go on the card's own partition.
- **As an app** on [Raspberry Pi OS](INSTALL.md#on-a-raspberry-pi), [macOS (ARM)](INSTALL.md#on-macos-arm) or [SteamOS and other Linux x86_64](INSTALL.md#on-steamos--linux-x86_64).

Tested on a Raspberry Pi 4 and a Raspberry Pi 5 (8 GB). On another board? Tell us how it went in an [issue](https://github.com/mehmetraif/OSD-OS/issues).
