# 240-MP

240-MP is a retro VCR style frontend to play content on [Raspberry Pi](https://github.com/anthonycaccese/240-MP/wiki/Hardware-Testing) (preferably hooked up to a CRT TV), Steam OS (and other Linux x86_64 distros) or MacOS (ARM).

Playback experiences are handled via modules to enable new integrations without requiring major changes to the overall frontend. Try to think of each module as a different input on a VHS deck. There are 10 included modules currently: [Local Files](https://github.com/anthonycaccese/240-MP/wiki/Module:-Local-Files), [Plex](https://github.com/anthonycaccese/240-MP/wiki/Module:-Plex), [Jellyfin](https://github.com/anthonycaccese/240-MP/wiki/Module:-Jellyfin), Emby, Netflix, Prime Video, [YouTube](https://github.com/anthonycaccese/240-MP/wiki/Module:-YouTube), [NFC Reader](https://github.com/anthonycaccese/240-MP/wiki/Module:-NFC-Reader), [Weather](https://github.com/anthonycaccese/240-MP/wiki/Module:-Weather) and a module similar to art/wallpaper modes on modern tvs called [Ambient:Mode](https://github.com/anthonycaccese/240-MP/wiki/Module:-Ambient-Mode).

It's built to work in conjuction with [MPV](https://github.com/anthonycaccese/240-MP/wiki/MPV) which will be installed (or updated) as a dependency during the [install](#Install) steps.  Some modules (like YouTube and NFC Reader) have additional dependencies which are covered on their associated wiki pages under the "To Enable" sections.

On a 4:3 screen a 16:9 picture is letterboxed; Settings → **Scaling** picks **14:9**, **Pan & Scan** or **Anamorphic** instead, for every module or, in a module's own settings, for that one.

### Local Files ([Wiki](https://github.com/anthonycaccese/240-MP/wiki/Module:-Local-Files))
- Supported file types: `"mp4", "mkv", "avi", "mov", "m4v", "webm", "wmv", "flv", "f4v", "mpg", "mpeg", "vob"`
- Playlist support using `m3u` and `m3u8` files
- Folder browsing as a horizontal tree: the open folders run along a line across the screen, every folder in the current one branches off to a few of its own entries, and the folder under the cursor branches once more
- **Recently Watched**, **Favorites** and **Search** lead the tree: what you played last, what you marked (right on a file, then **Add to Favorites**), and file and folder names anywhere in the media folder, typed on an on-screen keyboard
- Loop playback
- Shuffle playback
- Playback history
- Switch audio/subtitle tracks during playback

### Netflix and Prime Video
- Browse what the service carries in your country in the same tree as Local Files: **Recently Watched** and **Favorites** first, then **Search** (on an on-screen keyboard), **Movies** and **Series** by Popular and by genre, a page of titles at a time with **More…** at the end
- Select on a title plays it straight away in the service's own web player, full screen. It opens at the title's own page on the service where [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org) knows it (by its TMDB or IMDb id), and at the service's search for it otherwise. **Netflix Home** / **Prime Video Home** opens the service as it is. 240-MP comes back when the player closes, with the tree as you left it
- The catalogue comes from [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org)'s API, which needs a free API key: put it (a v3 key or a v4 read access token) on the first line of `tmdb_api_key.txt` in the data folder. Each module's settings set the country and the language of the titles
- Neither service has an API for a front end like this one, and their streams are DRM-protected, so playback is the official site in Chromium with Widevine, not a 240-MP view: use it with a keyboard (arrow keys move between titles) or a mouse
- A title's info screen (story, genre, director or creator, cast, rating) comes up when the cursor has rested on it for 3 seconds, or at once with right; Settings → **Info Screen** sets the seconds, or **Key** for right only, or **Off**
- Right on the info screen (or on the title, with the info screen off) offers its options: **Add to Favorites** or **Remove from Favorites**
- Come back by holding back (`[ESC]` / `[B]`) for two seconds, or by closing the browser (`Ctrl+W`)
- Each keeps its sign-in between visits; **Sign out** in its settings forgets it
- Needs `chromium`, `libwidevinecdm0` and, without a desktop, `cage` (on Raspberry Pi OS: `sudo apt install chromium libwidevinecdm0 cage`); the 240-MP OS image has them
- Off by default; enable them in Settings
- This product uses the TMDB API but is not endorsed or certified by TMDB. Which service carries a title where comes from [JustWatch](https://www.justwatch.com), through TMDB

### NFC Reader ([Wiki](https://github.com/anthonycaccese/240-MP/wiki/Module:-NFC-Reader))
- Start video playback via NFC cards
  - Supports the mapping of video paths, YouTube URLs and content from a Plex library
- Reader support:
  - `PN532 USB` — recommended. Needs no drivers or daemon on any platform, so it also works on immutable distros like SteamOS
  - `ACS ACR122U` and other PC/SC contactless readers — needs `pcscd` (see `scripts/setup-nfc-reader.sh`)
- Readers are detected automatically; no configuration needed
- Maps cards to videos via per-card text files in a `nfc_tags` data directory
- Tapping an unknown card auto-creates a stub tag file for it

### Plex ([Wiki](https://github.com/anthonycaccese/240-MP/wiki/Module:-Plex))
- Supported library types: `Movies, TV Shows, Other Videos`
- Server switching
- User profile switching and auto sign in
- Select specific libraries to display
- Continue Watching and Resume
- Autoplay next episode in a season (optional, off by default)
- Write an NFC card for any movie, episode, season or show from its detail screen to use with the NFC Reader module
- Hub, Playlist, Collection and Category support
- Folder browsing — walk a library by its on-disk folder structure
- Movie editions
- Select preferred audio/subtitle track before playback and switch tracks during playback
- Full library browsing by letter
- Show/Season browsing
- Video quality selection: Direct Playback (Default) or Transcode options

### Scripts ([Wiki](https://github.com/anthonycaccese/240-MP/wiki/Module:-Scripts))
- Run your own `.sh` scripts from a folder, so 240-MP can launch anything else on the machine (FieldStation42, RetroArch, `yt-dlp -U`, updates)
- Two run modes per script, set in its `.txt` file:
    - `console` — 240-MP stays on screen and shows the script's output
    - `takeover` — the script gets the whole display, and 240-MP returns when it exits
- A `.txt` file beside each script sets its display name and options; one is created for you automatically the first time a script is seen
- Mark a script as a favorite to put it on the main menu alongside the other modules (press play/pause on it in the list)
- Optionally auto-run one script when 240-MP starts
- Off by default; enable it in Settings and point it at your scripts folder

### Weather ([Wiki](https://github.com/anthonycaccese/240-MP/wiki/Module:-Weather))
- Inspired by [WeatherStar 3000+](https://github.com/netbymatt/ws3kp) by netbymatt
- Integrates with Open-Meteo to provide weather forecasts for worldwide locations
- Integrates with NWS to provide current conditions for US locations
- For your main location it displays Current Conditions and Extended (3-day forecast)
- Can display forecast data for 6 additional locations
- Supports background music, US/Metric Units and 12-hour/24-hour time display

### YouTube ([Wiki](https://github.com/anthonycaccese/240-MP/wiki/Module:-YouTube))
- List content from YouTube RSS feeds and playback via mpv + yt-dl (no auth required)
- Browse it all in the same tree as Local Files: **Recently Watched**, **Favorites**, **Search**, **Subscriptions**, **Channels**, **Playlists** and **Watch Later**
- Search YouTube on an on-screen keyboard (through yt-dlp), twenty matches at a time with **More…** at the end
- View Subscriptions: Browse the latest videos from your configured channels as a reverse chronological list
- Browse videos by Channel, and by Playlist
- A video's info screen (channel, date, length, views, description), like the streaming catalogues'; right on it (or, with the info screen off, on the video) offers its options: add it to **Favorites**, or save it to a local **Watch Later** list
- **Recently Watched** is your local watch history
- Resume Playback
- Set Playback Resolution: 480p (default and good for the RaspberryPi), 720p and 1080p
- Choose to Display Shorts or not (default is On)

## FAQs

- Why didn't you use Kodi/LibreELEC/OSMC?
    - I've used all of those distros and they are all excellent but I also like making things and wanted something simpler without as many options.  Something that felt like a VCR from my youth.
- Should I use 240-MP instead of Kodi/LibreELEC/OSMC?
    - I would recommend thinking about it like this...
    - All of those distros are amazing, feature rich, work across a ton of devices and have awesome supportive teams behind them.
    - I on the other hand am just one person making nostalgic things for my own niche use cases.
    - If those use cases match with what you're looking for, then 240-MP is a bunch of fun and I'd be happy for you to try it.
    - Otherwise, the well known distros are spectacular and you should likely open those doors instead.
- Will this work on other Raspberry Pi models? (like the 5, 2 zero, etc...)
    - I've tested on the 4b, 3b+ and 3b. Other users have confimred the 5 works well too and all the details on what we've confimred can be found here: https://github.com/anthonycaccese/240-MP/wiki/Hardware-Testing
    - If its not on that list then the short answer is "we don't know but please feel free try and let us know if it works"
- Where does the name "240-MP" come from?
    - 240 has a double meaning referring to the longest [VHS tape length](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VHS#Tape_lengths) and love for [CRT TVs](https://consolemods.org/wiki/CRT:What_is_240p%3F) as a display type.
    - MP also has a double meaning of "Media Player" and a play on the "SP/LP/EP/SLP" terminology that was used to refer to the recording quality for VHS recordings.
- Does the 240 in the name mean that it outputs at 240p resolution?
    - The UI scales based on the OS config and output cables you are using.
    - For example: the output resolution for the menu and video playback when using it on a CRT with the configs I use is 480i/576i
- Does 240-MP support RGB out instead of composite?
    - 240-MP is just an app that runs on top of an already configured Operating System. If you are able to configure your OS on the Raspberry Pi to output over RGB then 240-MP will simply scale and display to that output when it boots up as well.
    - If you have a combination of RGB out + OS configuration that works well then please add a comment here with your set up details: https://github.com/anthonycaccese/240-MP/discussions/44
- Does 240-MP work over HDMI on a modern television too?
    - Yes! The UI was built to scale on modern televisions over HDMI as well.
    - Please make sure you use the config.txt I provide for HDMI and it will output at the proper resolution for a modern tv.
- Does 240-MP support bluetooth keyboards/remotes/controllers?
    - 240-MP is just an app that runs on top of an already configured Operating System. If your OS has a way to configure and set up bluetooh controllers then 240-MP will simply see them as controllers when it boots up.
