// The picture is drawn on the GPU where Qt Quick draws with OpenGL: on a
// thread of its own, with a context that shares its objects with the scene
// graph's (Qt::AA_ShareOpenGLContexts), mpv converts and scales into one of a
// few textures, which VideoSurface shows as they are, and the hardware decoder
// hands it frames without a copy. Elsewhere (Metal on macOS, the software
// scene graph, OpenGL drawn on the CPU), or should that fail, libmpv's
// software renderer draws it on the CPU, on a thread of its own, at the size
// the VideoSurface asks for.
//
// A session takes an mpv command line (start(args), the one MpvController
// builds) and turns it into options and a playlist. It ends when mpv quits,
// or its playlist has played out: finished(lastEndReason), with the reason the
// last file ended ("eof", "quit", "stop", "error", "redirect").
