// ALSA's own default is left as it is; each player is told the card as it
// starts: mpv (a video, Ambient Mode's and Weather's music) with
// --audio-device, any other program (a web player's browser, a script) with
// ALSA_CARD in its environment, and a video playing behind the menus moves to
// a new one at once (MpvController::followAudioOutput). A card chosen but
// unplugged is passed over until it is back: sound goes where it would
// without the setting.
//
// Offered on Linux where nothing between the players and ALSA picks the card
// itself, no PipeWire or PulseAudio server: the OS image. OSDOS_ASOUND_DIR
// stands in for /proc/asound, for tests.
