// Settings → Menu Music, or a theme's: a tune looping under the menus. Main.qml
// says what plays (`source`, a sound file, "" for none), how loud (`volume`,
// 0 to 100) and when it is wanted: in the menus, and never while a video
// plays or loads. An mpv process plays it, on Settings → Audio Output's card.
//
// A recording (OGG, Opus, MP3, FLAC, WAV, M4A, AAC) and a tracker's module
// (XM, MOD, S3M, IT, through ffmpeg's libopenmpt) play as they are. A MIDI
// file is played by FluidSynth into a WAV first, with a SoundFont: the file's
// own (beside it, of its name), the first in the data folder's `soundfonts`,
// or the system's General MIDI one. So is a module mpv can't play, by
// openmpt123, where it is installed. What they make is kept in the cache
// folder (the newest only), so it is made once for a file.
//
// Anything about to play sound of its own (a video, a module's music, a script
// or a web player) holds it off first: hold() stops it there and then, so the
// sound card is free before the other starts, and it plays again once nothing
// holds it and it is still wanted, from the start. A file mpv can't play isn't
// tried again until the source changes.
