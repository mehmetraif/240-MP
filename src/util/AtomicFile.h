// Writes a file whole, the way every file the app keeps its state in is
// written: into a new file beside it, renamed over it once complete and on
// the disk (QSaveFile). A crash, a power cut or a full disk on the way leaves
// the file as it was, never cut short, and a reader never sees half of it.
// That matters most for config.json, whose readers take a file they can't
// read for none at all: the next save would write the defaults over every
// setting. `permissions`, when given, are set before anything is written
// (owner-only, for a token or a key); otherwise the file keeps those of the
// one it replaces. False, with the reason in the log, when it couldn't be
// written: the file is then as it was.
