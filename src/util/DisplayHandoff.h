// Brackets a fullscreen external process on headless Linux (RPi Lite / EGLFS),
// where Qt owns the DRM device and a child that wants the screen can't simply
// open a window over ours.
//
// One instance owns the hand-off for the whole app, so two subsystems can never
// both believe they hold the screen: acquire() takes an owner token and refuses
// if a different owner already holds it.
//
// The ORDER HERE IS LOAD-BEARING and was established against real Pi hardware —
// do not reorder it, and do not re-implement these ioctls in a new caller:
//
//   acquire():  VT switch  ->  drmDropMaster  ->  save CRTC state
//     The VT switch goes FIRST because it suspends Qt's render thread via the
//     kernel's VT-switch signal before DRM master is dropped. On kernels 5.8+
//     drmSetMaster() returns EACCES for non-root while any other process holds
//     master, and Qt EGLFS runs VT_AUTO and never calls drmDropMaster() itself.
//
//   release():  drmSetMaster  ->  restore CRTC (and clear the cursor)  ->  VT switch back
//     Exactly the inverse. The CRTC restore uses LEGACY drmModeSetCrtc, not an
//     atomic commit: the child's atomic cleanup leaves CRTC_ACTIVE=0, and EGLFS
//     then gets EINVAL on its first page flip.
//     The default 200 ms defer lets the child's last pending KMS commit clear in
//     the vc4 driver; commit too early and EGLFS gets EBUSY repeatedly, drops its
//     DRM pipeline, and the kernel falls back to the text console on Qt's VT.
//     200 ms is more than three VSync periods at 60 Hz.
//
// On macOS and on desktop Linux (X11/Wayland present) there is nothing to hand
// off — the child just opens a window over ours — so acquire() is a no-op that
// returns 0 and every other call short-circuits.
