// Prime Video, one instance each. Neither has an API a front end like this one
// could browse with, and their streams are Widevine-protected, so mpv can't
// play them; Chromium with Widevine can. scripts/web-player.sh works out how
// to run the browser on each target, under the cage kiosk compositor on a
// headless Pi, and this runs it as a takeover through its own ScriptLauncher,
// the way the Scripts module runs a takeover script: on a headless Pi
// DisplayHandoff brackets the run, and the screen comes back once the browser
// and everything it started have exited. Its catalog (TmdbCatalog) is what the
// module browses before it opens a title.
//
// The browser keeps a profile of its own per service, and the service's
// sign-in lives there: SIGN IN in the module's settings opens signInUrl in it,
// and signOut() deletes it. YouTube's sign-in is one of these too, with no
// catalogue, owned by YouTubeBackend, whose yt-dlp reads the sign-in from it.
