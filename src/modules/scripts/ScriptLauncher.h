// * console  — OSD/OS keeps the screen and the script's merged stdout/stderr is
//              streamed into a QML view. Identical on every target.
// * takeover — the script owns the screen. On macOS / desktop Linux / SteamOS
//              that needs nothing: the child's window covers ours, exactly like
//              mpv. On a headless Pi it is bracketed by DisplayHandoff (VT switch
//              + drmDropMaster + CRTC save/restore).
//
// The child is always put in its own session/process group (setsid), so stopping
// a script takes its children with it rather than orphaning whatever it spawned —
// and in takeover mode that group is also how we know the screen is free again.
